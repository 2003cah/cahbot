## Install CahBot!

For some odd reason, you want to run CahBot for yourself! Ok! So how do ya do it?

Requirements: Git, Ruby (duh) and Bundler Gem. I'm not sure how you install either, so find it out for youself lol

1) Get the files: `git clone https://github.com/Cahbots/Cahbot.git`

2) GO TO THE DIRECTORY: `cd Cahbot`

3) Install the gems: `bundle install`

4) Get your token and put that right on into the config

5) Rename the config to config.rb

6) `bundle exec ruby code.rb`

Or if you like that copy-paste thing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Cahbots/CahBot.git
cd CahBot
bundle install
```

(get the token and stuff)

```
bundle exec ruby code.rb
```

## Updating CahBot

It's simple. Stop the bot and run `git pull`. Then run the bot again!

Woah.

Something didn't work? Cool beans.
